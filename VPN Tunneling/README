This is the README file for the tun_server.c and tun_client.c code.

To perform the Task we have to run the tun_server.c file in the server machine(192.168.15.6)
The following command is used to compile this file.
gcc -o tun_server tun_server.c -lcrypto -lssl

Run using:
sudo ./tun_server {PORT_NUMBER}
example:
sudo ./tun_server 30010

We have to run the tun_client.c file in the server machine(192.168.15.7)
The following command is used to compile this file.
gcc -o tun_client tun_client.c -lcrypto -lssl

Run using:
sudo ./tun_client {SERVER_IP} {SERVER_PORT_NUMBER}
example:
sudo ./tun_client 192.168.15.6 30010
