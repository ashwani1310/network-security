This is the README file for the udp.c code submitted as part of CS528 Assignment 3.

All the configurations in the Apollo, dns_attacker, and dns_user are made as written in the Assignment's instructions.

To perform the Task we have to run the udp.c file in the dns_attacker machine.
The following command is used to compile this file.
gcc udp.c -o udp -lpcap

This compiled udp file is run using the following command:
sudo ./udp 192.168.15.8 192.168.15.6

The first argument to the above command is the Attacker's machine IP and the second argument in the Apollo server's IP.

The following commands are run in Apollo to flush the DNS and then see if the DNS cache is poisoned or not while this code runs.

sudo rndc flush
sudo rndc dumpdb -cache
cat /var/cache/bind/dump.db | grep attacker
